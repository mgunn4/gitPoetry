Mechanics starts in the basics,
while thermodynamics is for relics.
Astrophyics loves comics,
in time you'll see optics.
At the end of the day,
physics is just mathematics.

First time working with git
I figured out commit
but the failure to merge
causes my rage to surge
I'm gonna throw a fit


Physics reminds me of tortoises!
It can't swim! Thats a win

Physics is really great! There is nothing less I hate!
Physics is great
Except is takes years off my life
Which is nice... I guess


I'm not creative.
I'm still not creative.
But here goes something.

Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
I was into this,
Until everyone knew.

I just lost the game.
Oh no
